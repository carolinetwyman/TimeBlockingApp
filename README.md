“How we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour and that one is what we are doing.” - Annie Dillard

This app helps you time block your days and help you get organized for living your life, today. Which day is it, exactly? That's displayed at the top of the page.

The present time is in a nice red color, so you can focus on the task at hand. Everything in the past is greyed out, and everything you can look forward to is in a bright green color. 

If you know that you like to check your emails first thing in the morning, you can jot that down in the 8am block. Click the save button to the right, and you'll see this task reappear every day in the future.

If you've moved to checking TikTok first thing in the morning, you may want to clear the timeslot. Who knows, maybe in the future you will add another, more... publishable task in there.
